# ðŸ”· Design Patterns in Software Engineering

This repository demonstrates examples of the **three main categories of design patterns** used in software design:

1. **Creational Patterns**
2. **Structural Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Patterns**

Each pattern addresses common software design problems and offers reusable solutions that follow best practices.

## ðŸ§± 1. Creational Patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**  
  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **Factory Method**  
  Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Abstract Factory**  
  Produces families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Builder**  
  Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

- **Prototype**  
  Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### ðŸ”¹ Use of Creational Patterns

- To control object creation and reduce tight coupling between classes.
- Improve flexibility by abstracting the instantiation process.
- Useful in systems that rely on dynamic and interchangeable object creation.

## ðŸ§© 2. Structural Patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**  
  Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

- **Bridge**  
  Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.

- **Composite**  
  Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **Decorator**  
  Adds new responsibilities to objects dynamically.

- **Facade**  
  Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

- **Flyweight**  
  Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.

- **Proxy**  
  Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object.

### ðŸ”¹ Use of Structural Patterns

- To simplify relationships between entities.
- Facilitate flexibility and reusability of code.
- Efficient management of object composition and abstraction layers.

## ðŸ”„ 3. Behavioral Patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer**  
  Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

- **Strategy**  
  Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.

- **Command**  
  Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization and queuing.

- **State**  
  Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

- **Chain of Responsibility**  
  Passes a request along a chain of handlers.

- **Mediator**  
  Reduces the communication complexity between classes.

- **Iterator**  
  Provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially.

- **Template Method**  
  Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps.

- **Memento**  
  Captures and restores an objectâ€™s internal state without violating encapsulation.

- **Visitor**  
  Separates an algorithm from the objects on which it operates.

### ðŸ”¹ Use of Behavioral Patterns

- To manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects.
- Enable dynamic behavior at runtime.
- Improve code maintainability and scalability by promoting loose coupling.
